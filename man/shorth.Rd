}

\details{The shorth is the shortest interval that covers half of the
  values in \code{x}. Its midpoint is the median of the data values
  that lie in the shorth and can be used as an
  estimator of the mode of the distribution that generated \code{x}.}

\value{The midpoint of the short of \code{x}.}
